                <p>Hi, I'm Shira Zeev. I grew up in California in the Bay Area, 
			and moved to New York City to pursue a Bachelor's degree at NYU. 
			I was drawn to the city itself as well as  NYU's Gallatin School of 
			Individualized Study which allowed to tailor my degree based on my passions. 
			I decided to focus on the intersection of graphic design, 
			computer science, and new media. I felt that this blend allowed me to apply my 
			analytical problem solving skills in a creative way. For the next chapter, 
			I plan to leverage the unique skill set I acquired in a professional setting.
