    <h1>CLUB PENGUIN</h1>
    <div id="canvas"></div>
    <br></br>
    <p>Welcome to our recreation of Club Penguin by Fran DiMiceli, Shira Zeev, Dariush Nashat, & Aaron Kates Club Penguin was a popular Massive Multiplayer Online Game (MMO) that we loved growing up. After Disney closed the platform down to be replaced with the short-lived "Club Penguin Island", there have been people trying to revive the game. Unforunately, all of these eventually get removed due to copyrights or safety issues.</p>
    <p>To solve this issue, we have created our own, simplified, version of the platform, removing any multiplayer features. We each picked one of our favorite games and decided to recreate them. All of the key components of this game are still there and we did our best to make out game as close to the originally as was logistically possible.</p>
    <p>Luckily, due to the massive popularity of the game, there are so many archived resources and attributes that allowed us to make our game as realistic as possible.</p>
    <br></br>
    <h2> How to play:</h2>
    <p>Click to move your penguin. When you click on the different available rooms, you will be able to open them and interact with what is in that room. To get to rooms that are not directly accessible, you can click on the map to access differnt areas. There are four total hub sections that you can travel to with the map.</p>
    <br></br>
    <p2><b>There are four total minigames that can be played.</b></p>
    <p2><b>Puffle Roundup: </b>(Plaza, Pet Shop) Corral puffels in under 60 seconds</p>
    <p2><b>Thin Ice: </b> (Town, Night Club, Upstairs) Tile based stragetic movement game</p>
    <p2><b>Cardjitsu: </b>(Dojo Courtyard, Dojo) Strategic card game where you play against a coded AI</p>
    <p2><b>Pizzatron 3000: </b>(Plaza, Pizzeria) Rush to make different pizza orders before it runs off the conveyer belt</p>  
    <br></br>
    <h3>Music Synth</h2>
    <p><b>There are three spaces where you can access the Music Synths. In these rooms, you can use the songs unlocked by achieving stamps within the minigames.</b></p>
    <p2><b>Coffee Shop: </b>(Town)</p>
    <p2><b>Gift Shop: </b>(Town)</p>
    <p2><b>EPF: </b>(Town)</p>
